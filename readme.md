Reasons why i use termite:
> Have no unnecessary bars \
> Fits perfectly with a windows manager (e.g. [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3)) \
> Looks very clean \
> Have 3 selection modes that helps copying text without the mouse \
> Slightly faster than most "loaded" terminal-emulators \
> Clean and useful configuration file at .config/termite/config \
> More little details i like

**Termite cannot be installed from apt's repositories**
