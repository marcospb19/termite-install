## termite-install

CAREFULL!:
> The script might break other terminal-emulators, like gnome-terminal, i recomend you unninstall gnome-terminal before installing termite, and reinstall it later (i'll soon this today and update this readme...) \
> Also, i don't really know how to unninstall termite after the script runs, i'll find out later

Reasons why i use termite:
> Have no additional bars and fits perfectly with a windows manager (e.g. [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3)) \
> Looks cleaner \
> Have an awesome selection mode \
> Slightly faster than more complex terminal-emulators \
> Has a clean configuration file (default at .config/termite/config, edit it!) \
> More nice details, contains features that i still need to read about...


Unfortunately, termite still not installable from apt (yet, and this is the reason this script exists)

This script was tested on:

> linux mint cinnamon 19-19.1 \
> ubuntu 16.04-18.10 \
> debian 9
