Reasons why i use termite:
> Have no additional bars and fits perfectly with a windows manager (e.g. [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3)) \
> Looks very clean \
> Have 3 awesome selection modes that helps copying text without the mouse \
> Slightly faster than most "loaded" terminal-emulators \
> Clean and useful configuration file at .config/termite/config \
> More little details i like

Unfortunately, termite still not installable from apt (yet, and this is the reason this script exists)

This script was tested on:

> linux mint cinnamon 19 - 19.1 \
> ubuntu 16.04 - 18.10 \
> debian 9
